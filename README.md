# nixos-configs

My nixos configuration files (system and home-manager)

## Usage

To deploy for a host after initial installation simply run the `deploy.sh`
script in the folder for host you want to deploy for (in the [hosts](./hosts)
directory). For initial installation (with encryption) see the `INSTALL.md` file
in the same folder.
